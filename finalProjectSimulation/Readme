This file contains the code for the final simulation of turtlebot3. Using ROS images are loaded and published, subcribed to 
for claasification. Once classified the class is published for the fetcher to initiate an action of simulating a fetch. Work 
is stil required to get the classification model working. It may be neccessary to switch to ROS2 to get my VGG16 fine-tuned 
model to make predictions in a ROS envirnoment. I am planning on improving the fetcher as well I want to implament a Composite 
Design pattern for the fetching process. Want to do in C++.
